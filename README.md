# Basic concepts of c & c++
## if- statement:
The statements inside the body of “if” only execute if the given condition returns true. If the condition returns false then the statements inside “if” are skipped.
## switch case
The switch case statement is used when we have multiple options and we need to perform a different task for each option.
## for loop
A loop is used for executing a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition returns false.
## while loop
The loop is used for executing a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition returns false. 
## implementation of inheritance 
The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important feature of Object Oriented Programming.
Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or Derived Class.
Super Class:The class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called Base Class or Super class
1. Single inheritance
2. Multiple inheritance
3. Multilevel inheritance
## function overloading
Function overloading is a feature in C++ where two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters.
Function overloading can be considered as an example of polymorphism feature in C++.
